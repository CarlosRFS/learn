# Learn RISC-V
[![Check Markdown links](https://github.com/riscv/learn/actions/workflows/action.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/riscv/learn/actions/workflows/action.yml)

A community-driven compilation of RISC-V resources and learning material. The list is dynamically updated by the community and categorized based on different contexts of the RISC-V scope, taking into account different levels of experience/knowledge, allowing anyone interested in RISC-V to discover resources (courses, software, documentation, articles) in an organized fashion.

**RISC-V** is an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) based on established Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) principles.
